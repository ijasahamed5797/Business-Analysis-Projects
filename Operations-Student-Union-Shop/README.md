# Student Union Shop - Operations Optimization using Queuing Theory

## Business Problem
Optimizing cashier staffing levels at a student union shop to balance customer wait times and operational costs using quantitative operations management techniques.

## Methodology
- **Queuing Theory Application:** Multi-server waiting model analysis
- **Data Analysis:** Customer arrival patterns and service time distributions
- **Excel Modeling:** Development of queuing model with variable server scenarios
- **Economic Analysis:** Cost-benefit analysis of additional staffing

## Key Scenarios Analyzed
1. **Current State (3 cashiers):** Unstable system with infinite queue growth
2. **Improved Scenario (4 cashiers):** Reduced wait times to 6.97 minutes average
3. **Optimal Scenario (5 cashiers):** Balanced cost-service level (2.01 minutes wait)
4. **Premium Service (6 cashiers):** Minimal wait times (0.27 minutes)

## Operational Recommendations
- Implementation of 5-cashier system for optimal balance
- Cost-saving of $200/day compared to 6-cashier system
- Significant reduction in customer wait times from unstable to 2.01 minutes average
- Improved customer satisfaction and reduced queue abandonment

## Quantitative Findings
- **Arrival Rate (λ):** 1.08 customers per minute
- **Service Rate (μ):** 0.357 customers per minute per cashier
- **Optimal Staffing:** 5 cashiers for system stability
- **Cost Analysis:** $20/hour per additional cashier vs. customer retention benefits

- Queuing Theory & Operations Management
- Excel Modeling & Data Analysis
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
